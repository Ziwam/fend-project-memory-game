Once you've matched all the cards, you win!
Star ratings are based strictly on the number of wrong matches.
Try to beat your **time** or your **rating**.

## Directions

Flip a card: **left-click** a black box to reveal its symbol.
Match cards: **flip two** cards with the same symbol.
Win: **match all** cards.
